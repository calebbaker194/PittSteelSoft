Only Software That runs on a platform will be in its own folder.

Any sofware will be in the sub folder of the program.
Example: Xtuple update that is run to automatically update xtuple clients on windows machines will 
not be located in \Xtuple because it is a bat file run on windows. It will be located at
\Windows\BATandPS1
